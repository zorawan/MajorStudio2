    <h2 id="HISTORY">History</h2>
    <p class="Intro">Imagine embarking on a journey to explore the evolution of user interface design over time. A
        journey that takes you back to the good old days when the floppy disk icon was the universal symbol for saving
        files. This iconic icon was an essential element in early user interface design and was universally recognized.
        Designers had to work with it to deliver an explicit affordance for the "save" button.
        However, the floppy disk icon has disappeared from most user interfaces with the advent of newer and more
        advanced ways of saving files. But the journey doesn't end here. We explore the impact of this transition on
        user experience and how designers have adapted to the changing times. Together, we'll discover how icons shape
        the user experience over time and hopefully predict these selected icons' future.</p>
