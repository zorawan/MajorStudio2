    <h3>The floppy disk icon represented a vital action when the early user interface was introduced. Save
        files was once an essential action required in many software products. For designers who work on the
        user interface need to cooperate with icons to deliver, an explicit affordance would use floppy disk
        icons for saving during the 80s and 90s. According to IBM, the company that creates the floppy disk:
        "The icon of a floppy disk remains the universal symbol for saving files." Indeed, the floppy disk
        icon was recognizable by almost everyone who has ever used a personal computer. However, the icon
        disappears from almost all the user interfaces.</h3>
    <h2>Factors For Prediction</h2>
    <h3><span style="color:#C1DB29;font-weight:bold">1. Recognition Testing </span>will help us understand how
        people react to each icon and how they interpret their
        meaning. <span style="color:#C1DB29;font-weight:bold">2. Skeuomorphism </span>is a user interface style
        that creates icons based on their shape in real life. Some objects may become extinct or no longer be
        used daily. Some objects may become extinct or no longer be used in our daily lives. <span
            style="color:#C1DB29;font-weight:bold">3. Universal icons</span> have been used widely in digital
        interfaces and are highly recognized by users.
        <span style="color:#C1DB29;font-weight:bold">4.New technologies </span>will change some of the users'
        interactions. For example, AI is already changing how people search for
        answers, and voice search has replaced how we ask
        questions. These new technologies will impact our understanding of visual representations like icons. We can
        detect these
        icons' future by considering all the factors above.
